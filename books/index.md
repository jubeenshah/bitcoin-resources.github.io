The following is an incomplete list of Bitcoin books worth reading. Some of the
books listed below were discussed at the [Bitcoiner Book
Club](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8GxRkxnvMl3_O3DYNQJFnVBvvt8A9qqW)
organized by John Vallis.

## General Bitcoin Books

Books about Bitcoin which can be read by anyone, no special background knowledge
or education required. As mentioned above, I consider [The Bitcoin
Standard][the-bitcoin-standard] required reading for anyone interested in
Bitcoin.

[the-bitcoin-standard]: {{ '/books/the-bitcoin-standard' | absolute_url }}

{% include books.html category='non-technical' %}

More books are coming out every year, relating Bitcoin to different fields
and examining it from different angles.

{% include books.html category='non-technical2' %}

The Internet of Money books are a collection of talks by Andreas Antonopoulos,
most of which are available for [free on YouTube][aantonop-bitcoin-talks]. The
Book Of Satoshi is a collection of Satoshi Nakamoto's writings, which are
available for free at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute][complete-satoshi].

## Bitcoin and Cypherpunk History

Bitcoin's origin story is as mysterious as it is fascinating. Invented by a
pseudonymous creator and growing organically as dark market money in its early
days, Bitcoin's history is rich with eccentric characters and entrepreneurs. The
following books highlight some of these characters while shining some light on
Bitcoin's early days. I highly recommend
[The Book Satoshi][the-book-of-satoshi], which collects all known writings of
Bitcoin's creator and  [American Kingpin][american-kingpin], which is a gripping
retelling of Bitcoin's early days and its application on The Silk Road
marketplace. [The Blocksize Wars][the-blocksize-war] is required reading as
well, at least for anyone who wants to understand Bitcoin's civil war and the
nature of the politics involved in this global consensus system.

## Bitcoin Programming

If you would like to dig deeper or get your hands dirty with programming, these
books are for you. Technical knowledge and skills in computer science,
programming, and/or mathematics are beneficial.

{% include books.html category='technical' %}

Mastering Bitcoin is [available for free on GitHub][mastering-bitcoin-free].
Programming Bitcoin includes plenty of [programming
exercises][programming-bitcoin-exercises], which are available for free on
GitHub as well. Grokking Bitcoin is [available for free on
GitHub][grokking-bitcoin-free] as well.

## Economics

Bitcoin is capable of being the new base layer of our economy, which is why
understanding economics is essential in understanding Bitcoin. Bitcoin's
monetary policy is aligned with the Austrian School of economic thought, which
is why reading the works of Austrian's such as Hayek, Hazlitt, Hoppe, Menger,
Mises, Rothbard (and others) is recommended by those who take Bitcoin's value
proposition seriously.

{% include books.html category='economics' %}

Human Action, Mises' magnum opus, is [freely available][human-action-free] as
both an ebook and an audiobook.

[human-action-free]: https://mises.org/library/human-action-0

## Money

In stark contrast to our current economic system, Bitcoin does not offer the
possibility of inflating the monetary base. Understanding money - and especially
*sound* money - is paramount to understanding the value proposition and ultimate
impact of Bitcoin.

{% include books.html category='money' %}

Most of the above are available for free at the Mises
Institute.

## Inflation

One of the best ways to understand the disastrous consequences of inflation is
to read books that describe what happens in a hyperinflation environment.

{% include books.html category='inflation' %}

If you want to read only one book to understand the perils of inflation, read
[When Money Dies][WMD] by Adam Fergusson.

[WMD]: {{ '/books/when-money-dies' | absolute_url }}

## Banking

Banking is a mystery to most, and central banking doubly so. Bitcoin isn't
necessarily an enemy of the former, but, if successful, it will abolish and
replace the latter.

{% include books.html category='banking' %}

## The Big Picture

Bitcoin is an empowering, freedom-enabling technology. It allows individuals to
become self-sovereign in matters of money and finance, just like other
information technologies enable self-sovereignty in matters of information and
communication. What this implies, and how the world might change because of it,
is the scope of [The Sovereign Individual].

{% include books.html category='macro' %}

We are currently living through the fourth great shift, moving from an
industrial to an information-based society. There is no better book to
understand this shift than the one by Davidson and Rees-Mogg.

[The Sovereign Individual]: {{ '/books/the-sovereign-individual' | absolute_url }}

## Fiction

While truth is often stranger than fiction, many fictional works exist that are
not only important to make sense of the world, but essential to navigate what
lies ahead and what role Bitcoin will play in particular.

> Fiction is Truth's elder sister. Obviously. No one in the world knew what
> truth was till some one had told a story.
>
> <cite>Rudyard Kipling</cite>

The following books are recommended often:

{% include books.html category='fiction' %}

## Software and Programming

Bitcoin is free, libre open-source software. It is free as in freedom, free as
in free speech. What this means, why free software exists, and what the
implications of free (vs proprietary) software are, is important to understand
the unstoppability of Bitcoin. I would argue that the ethos of GNU and UNIX
programming are important cornerstones for Bitcoin as well.

{% include books.html category='software' %}

## Computation and Complexity Theory

While Bitcoin is in the business of verification and not computation, knowing
the limits of what computers can do and what future computers might be able to
do can be beneficial to better understand some parts of Bitcoin. I highly
recommend [Gödel, Escher, Bach][gödel-escher-bach] because it is a deeply
fascinating and beautiful book.

[gödel-escher-bach]: {{ '/books/gödel-escher-bach' | absolute_url }}

{% include books.html category='computation' %}

[Quantum Computing Since Democritus][quantum-computing-since-democritus] is
quite dense, but it is also quite entertaining at times. The [lecture
notes][quantum-computing-since-democritus-free] which this book is based upon
are freely available online. Note that the first couple of chapters stay in the
non-quantum world of computing and might help to understand why breaking
Bitcoin's security is so hard. [A New Kind of Science][a-new-kind-of-science] is
certainly not for everyone, but it beautifully shows how simple rules can lead
to complex systems.

## Nassim Taleb

Highly improbable events, such as the invention of Bitcoin, are almost
impossible to predict. However, Nassim Taleb wrote multiple
books on concepts that help to foster a solid understanding of Bitcoin. In
short, the invention of Bitcoin is a *Black Swan* event resulting in an
*antifragile* organism. Miners are *"fooled by randomness"* to keep it alive,
and participation requires *skin in the game*. Unfortunately, Taleb [fails to
appreciate][fragile-nassim] the beauty of Bitcoin and
currently suffers from [Bitcoin Derangement Syndrome][BDS].

## Work

Decentralized networks like Bitcoin, and the internet before it, change the way
people interact and work with each other. People who work on or create content
for Bitcoin are located all over the world, thus regular approaches to work
might not produce the best results. I found the following books to hit a certain
nerve, speaking as someone who has stepped outside of the regular way of working
on things. If you think about working on Bitcoin or other open-source projects,
these books are for you.
